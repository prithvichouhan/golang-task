# GOLANG-TASK


## Overview
This is the implementation of Golang test task for Project 1 and Project 2.

## Project 1

I developed a server name frequency-calculator. It contains a POST API named words count that will take the input text in POST BODY and return top 10 most occured words in the text. 

## Documentation
For frequency-calculator documentation read: https://github.com/prithvichouhan/golang-task/blob/main/frequency-calculator/readme.md.


## Project 2

Create a script for project 2 that reads input from a text file, calls the wordscount POST API on the frequency-calculator server, gets the response and prints the result in CLI.

For project2 script documentation read: https://github.com/prithvichouhan/golang-task/tree/main/project2
